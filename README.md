# MovieRatingPrediction

This project aims to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques based on various features such as genre, cast, director, budget, and more. By analyzing historical data from popular movie databases, the model attempts to estimate how a new or existing movie might be rated by audiences or critics.

Project Objectives:
  To perform comprehensive data preprocessing and feature engineering on movie metadata.
  To apply regression models for predicting numerical movie ratings.
  To evaluate model performance using standard regression metrics.
  To provide insights into the most influential features affecting movie ratings.
